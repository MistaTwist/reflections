What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates the hidden .git folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It's a temporary area, in which files to be updated at once can go, then a single commit can be run.

	Use git diff with no arguments to show changes that aren't in the staging area yet, ie unadded.

	Use git diff --staged to see changes in staging that are not in the most recent commit.

	working directory
	staging area - git add to puts things here ready for commits.
	repo - where things are after commit.

	git reset -- hard in either the staging area or the working directory. BE CAREFUL WITH THIS.
	
How an you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	you can add one file change at a time using the git add command.

	git allows labelling for commit - aka branches.

		main branch: master.

	git branch gives us the currently checked out branch. In a single-branched 
	git branch [branch-name]
	git checkout [branch-name]

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	You could create branches for work done by week or month if you wanted a history than the results of a git status.



combining two branches is called a merge.
